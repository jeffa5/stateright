//! This module provides code to define and verify the correctness of
//! an object or system based on how it responds to a collection of potentially
//! concurrent (i.e. partially ordered) operations.
//!
//! # Defining Correctness Via A Reference Implementation
//!
//! [`SequentialSpec`] is a trait for defining correctness via a "reference implementation" (e.g.
//! "*this system should behave like a queue*").  Stateright includes reusable implementations such
//! as [`register`] for register-like semantics and [`vec`] for stack-like semantics.  Implementing
//! the trait yourself is also straightforward -- just define two `enum`s for invocations and
//! returns. Then associate these (as [`SequentialSpec::Op`] and [`SequentialSpec::Ret`]
//! respectively) with a state type that implements [`SequentialSpec::invoke`].
//!
//! # Verifying Concurrent System Implementations
//!
//! A concurrent system can be verified against an implementation of the [`SequentialSpec`] trait
//! by using a [`ConsistencyTester`] for an expected [consistency model],  such as
//! [`LinearizabilityTester`]. In that case, operations are sequential (think blocking I/O) with
//! respect to an abstract thread-like caller, which is identified by a distinct "thread ID"
//! (sometimes called a "process ID" in the literature, but these are assumed to be
//! single-threaded, so thread ID arguably provides better intuition for most developers).
//!
//! An [`actor::Id`] for instance can serve as a thread ID  as long as the
//! actor does not invoke a second operation in parallel with the first. This
//! restriction only exists for the purposes of verifying consistency semantics,
//! and actors need not sequence their operations to a concurrent
//! system outside of that use case. Alternatively, a single actor could maintain
//! its own [`ConsistencyTester`] with local thread IDs for multiple concurrent
//! invocations.
//!
